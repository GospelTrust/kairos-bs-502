### The Accounts of Saul's Death in `1 Samuel 31` and in `2 Samuel 1`

1. Read `1 Samuel 31`. It records the death of Saul.

2. According to `1 Sam 31`, precisely how did Saul die? (`2 points`)

3. We are also given an account of Saul's death in `2 Sam 1`. Read `2 Sam 1:1-16`.

4. According to `2 Sam 1`, precisely how did Saul die? (`2 points`)

5. Are the two accounts generally similar? (`1 point`)

6. But is there a significant difference between them? (hint) What is it? (`2 points`)

7. How can we explain the difference between these two accounts? (`2 points`)

8. Read on to `2 Sam 2:7`.

9. Does a prophet of God appear and condemn David for having the Amalekite put to death? (`1 point`)

10. Is there an "editorial comment" in the text that says what David did was evil? (`1 point`)

11. Perhaps(?) the Bible does not condemn this because David was the king, and so he could do what he wanted. In the OT, can kings of Israel do whatever they want? If you heard someone try to explain it that way, how could we reply to him from the Scriptures? (`3 points`)

12. Note exactly what David says to the Amalekite in `2 Sam 1:14`. Have we seen those words before in `1 Samuel`? Where? (`1 point`)
