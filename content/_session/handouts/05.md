## A. The Importance of Context

#### As concerns the genre of Scripture—
While much of the Bible is written using figurative language (see [Handout #07] on OT Poetry), nonetheless, most of the Bible is written in a straight-forward manner.

#### As concerns semantics—
While we need to carefully examine the meaning & use of some words in the Bible, nonetheless, most of the time the meaning of the words used in the Bible is clear.

Since that is the case, then in general, the single most important factor for interpreting the Bible correctly is paying attention to the context.

## B. Correctly Appreciating the Context

1. Do not read the Bible as if it were made up of unconnected verses, floating in space.

   For example: We examined `James 2:24` in [Handout #04] ("Semantics & Grammar").

   > `James 2:24` — "We see that a person is _justified by works_, and not by faith alone."

   One key insight in interpreting `James 2:24` was to examine the semantic range of the verb, "to justify."

   What was the other key insight for rightly interpreting `James 2:24`?

   - Question: Which book of the Bible can we read as separate individual verses?

   - Answer:

2. To be specific: The meaning of the verse must fit the _local context_ and(!) the _larger structure of the book_.

   Example: `Romans 14:22` reads:
   > "Whatever you believe about these things, keep between yourself and God."

   Does this mean we should not share the gospel?

   - So it is very important to ask: What is Paul talking about in `Romans ch. 14`?

   - Answer:

3. Similarly: Do not violate either the _clear general teaching of scripture_ or the _local context of a passage_

   For example: It is legitimate to say,

   > I do not know what to do with `James 2`, because it seems to contradict Romans, Galatians, Ephesians and the Gospel of John.

   When we say that, we are respecting the clear general teaching of Scripture.

   On the other hand, it is not legitimate to conclude,

   > The purpose of `James 2`, I guess, must be to explain that we are saved by faith apart from works.

   If we did that, we would be ignoring the local context of `James ch. 2`.

## C. Some Examples of Passages which Have a Fairly Lengthy Local Context:
- `Romans 1-8` (!)
- `Romans 9-11`.
- `1 Corinthians 8-10`.
- `1 Corinthians 12-14`.
- `Galatians 1-4`
- `Hebrews 1-10`.

## D. Two Quick Practice Examples:

- `Habakkuk 1:14` — "You have made men like the fish of the sea…" ← Means what?
- What *topic* is Paul addressing in `Gal 3:28`?

## E. One Quick Example for Thought:

In `1 Corinthians 14:20`, Paul tells the Corinthians,

> "Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regards to evil be infants, but in your thinking, be adults."

From the local context, can we determine what Paul thought was child-like in their thinking?

## F. One Specific Example: `Romans 2:13`
`Romans 2:6-8`, and `2:13` read as follows:

> 6 "God will give to each person according to what he has done. 7 To those who persist in doing good and seeking glory, honor and immortality, God will give eternal life. 8 But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger."

> 13 "For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous."

So → Are we saved by works? If we wish to go to heaven, do we need to be good all of the time, so that we can earn our way to heaven? How are we to understand this passage?
