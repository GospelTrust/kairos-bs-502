## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course is the foundational course for all other Bible &amp; theology courses taught at Kairos University.
This course sets forth the basic principles and insights by which we interpret the Bible soundly. There will
be initial lectures, plus practice assignments for developing practical skills, and class discussion, along with
quizzes and a final exam.

**The graduate-level version of this course (BS 502)** goes beyond the basic principles and the primary
practical skills for reading the Bible soundly. It develops a more carefully considered framework which
addresses why some interpretive approaches are more sound than others. It will equip the student to be
able to identify approaches that are not sound, to explain why they are not, and to better understand and be
able to explain the characteristics which make for a sound interpretive approach. For graduate students,
there will be additional reading, two additional assignments, additional handouts, and one or two more
additional Zoom sessions.

## COURSE OBJECTIVES

The goal of this course is for students to be able read and interpret the Bible soundly, and so to be able to
feed themselves and others spiritually.

This course will equip students with fundamental insights concerning how we interpret the Bible, and why.
It will stress and illustrate the importance of insights such as the following:

- What is the context of the passage we are reading?

  (This is vital in passages like Romans 2 and Romans 14.)

- Is the language in a passage straight-forward, or is it figurative?

  (For example: _Does God sleep?_ Ps 44:23 sounds like He does... but does He?)

- What do the words mean?

  (Especially terms such as &quot;justification&quot; and &quot;sanctification.&quot;)

- What events and earlier books in the Bible set the stage for understanding the passage I am looking at now?

  (This is essential for making sense of the Old Testament.)

- How does a basic knowledge of the culture and customs of the times in which the Bible was written
help shed light on the meaning of the text? This includes items such as:

  – The pagan understanding of the cosmos (in contrast to a biblical understanding).
  – What is a covenant, and how do covenants function?
  – How Greek culture and Roman government affected the Jews at the time of Jesus.
  – The Jewish culture into which Jesus spoke.

The course will set forth these insights, will illustrate them from Scripture, and then will give the student
practice on multiple passages. Mastering these insights will give students increasing confidence that they
can read the Scriptures soundly, which is foundational to everything we do in the Christian faith and life.
