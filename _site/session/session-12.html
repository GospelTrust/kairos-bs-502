Greek influence would remain a factor in Jewish culture. But the tendency for Jews to adopt Greek customs &amp; culture faded when Judah became independent (166 BC), and largely ended around 100 BC.Also during the inter-testamental period, some kings, even Jewish kings (during the Hasmonean era, 166-63 BC), violated the requirements of the OT Law, and did not chose high  priests from the line of Aaron / Eleazar / Zadok. The result was that many Jews regarded such high priests as corrupt and illegitimate, and did not accept them.As a result of this, by the time of Jesus, there were four main division, four main sects, among the Jews: The Essenes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Zealots.The Four Divisions, the Four Sects of Jews, during the Life of Jesus:  The Essenes (They are not mentioned in the NT.)

C. The Jewish Institutions:      The Temple, i.e., the Second Temple.    It is sometimes called “Herod’s Temple” because he greatly expanded it, over several years  But Jews call it simply “the second temple.”    Jesus prophesied the destruction of the second temple in Luke 19:44. The second temple was destroyed by the Romans in AD 70. Since then, the temple has not been rebuilt.        The Sanhedrin (in the NT they are sometimes called “the chief priests”)    From the time of the return from the exile (536 / 516 BC), until the time of Jesus, Judah was only independent for about 100 years (166-63 BC).    When post-exilic Judah was under the control of another nation (Persia, then the Ptolemies, then the Seleucids, then later Rome), the Jewish high priest and the elders exercised much local control over Judah.    In the time of Jesus, the council of priests &amp; elders who exercised much local control over Judea was called the Sanhedrin (see Matt 26:57-59). It had 71 members. The Sanhedrin was the council before which Jesus was put on trial before he was crucified.        The Office of High Priest    Since the days of Aaron &amp; Moses, they had always come from the tribe of Levi, and from the family line of Zadok. (Ezek 40:46, 45:15).    In 174 B.C., Antiochus IV began appointing High Priests on the basis of the amounts of tribute they promised to provide him.    During the Hasmonean era (166-63 BC), the Hasmonean kings served as the high priests.    They were from the tribe of Levi, but they were not from the line of Zadok.        Once the Romans took over (63 BC), the Roman ruler appointed the high priest. King Herod also did so when he ruled Judea (starting in 37 BC).    During the life of Jesus, Judea was under the direct rule of a Roman governor/prefect. It was the Roman governor (such as Pontius Pilate) who appointed the high priests. They almost always appointed high priests from wealthy families of the…    In the time of Jesus, the high priest was very influential, even to the Romans. Because Rome recognized him as the representative of the Jewish nation.    Thus the relationship between the Roman governors of Judea and the high priests was complex. On the one hand, the governors appointed the high priests. But on the other hand, the high priest can potentially get a governor fired by complaining to Rome.  D. The Samaritans:The NT mentions the Samaritans (Matt 10:5; John ch. 4). It makes it clear that they do not get along well with the Jews. The first Samaritans become Christians in Acts 8.Their Origins: 2 Kings 17 records the fall of Samaria to Assyria. The Assyrians deported thousands of Israelites. But they also imported thousands of people from other countries to live in Israel. The Samaritans are probably a result of the racial mixing between the Israelites who remained and the Gentiles who were brought in. They did worship Yahweh as God, but they only recognized the Torah as Scripture, not the Prophets or the Writings. They also believed the temple should be on Mt. Gerizim (Deut 11:29, 27: 12; Josh 8:33; 4:20), not in Jerusalem." />

<p>As a result of this, by the time of Jesus, there were four main division, four main sects, among the Jews: The Essenes, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Zealots.</p>

<p>The Four Divisions, the Four Sects of Jews, during the Life of Jesus:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>The Essenes</strong> (They <em>are</em> not mentioned in the NT.)
    <ul>
      <li>Essenes… <em>rejected high priests</em> &amp; <em>hated hellenization</em></li>
      <li>They chose to… <em>leave</em></li>

      <li>They were the smallest sect.</li>
      <li>The Essenes disappeared from history.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The Pharisees</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Like the Essenes, they rejected Hellenization, and they agreed that the high priesthood was corrupt.</li>
      <li>But unlike the Essenes, the Pharisees… <em>chose to stay</em></li>
      <li>They accepted the authority of…  <em>oral law (tradition)</em></li>
      <li>Unlike the Sadducees, the Pharisees believed in… <em>afterlife</em></li>
      <li>In general, they followed the Law and separated themselves from things that were “unclean” (see for example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">John 18:28</code>).</li>
      <li>Jesus sometimes criticized them harshly (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matt ch. 23</code>). But from the writings of Flavius Josephus, we know that the Jews generally regarded them well. They respected them for their knowledge of the Torah = the OT.</li>

      <li>This is the group that actively promoted… <em>rebel against Rome</em></li>
      <li>They believed it was a sin against God…  <em>pay taxes</em></li>

<h2 id="c-the-jewish-institutions">C. The Jewish Institutions:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Temple</strong>, i.e., the <strong>Second Temple</strong>.</p>

    <p>It is sometimes called “Herod’s Temple” because he greatly expanded it, over several years  But Jews call it simply “the second temple.”</p>

    <p>Jesus prophesied the destruction of the second temple in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Luke 19:44</code>. The second temple was destroyed by the Romans in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AD 70</code>. Since then, the temple has not been rebuilt.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Sanhedrin</strong> (in the NT they are sometimes called “the chief priests”)</p>

    <p>From the time of the return from the exile (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">536</code> / <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">516 BC</code>), until the time of Jesus, Judah was only independent for about 100 years (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">166-63 BC</code>).</p>

    <p>When post-exilic Judah was under the control of another nation (Persia, then the Ptolemies, then the Seleucids, then later Rome), the Jewish high priest and the elders exercised much local control over Judah.</p>

    <p>In the time of Jesus, the council of priests &amp; elders who exercised much local control over Judea was called the Sanhedrin (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matt 26:57-59</code>). It had 71 members. The Sanhedrin was the council before which Jesus was put on trial before he was crucified.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Office of High Priest</strong></p>

    <p>Since the days of Aaron &amp; Moses, they had always come from the tribe of Levi, and from the family line of Zadok. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ezek 40:46, 45:15</code>).</p>

    <p>In 174 B.C., <strong>Antiochus IV</strong> began appointing High Priests on the basis of the amounts of tribute they promised to provide him.</p>

    <p>During the Hasmonean era (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">166-63 BC</code>), the Hasmonean kings served as the high priests.</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>They were from the tribe of Levi, but they were not from the line of Zadok.
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>Once the Romans took over (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">63 BC</code>), the Roman ruler appointed the high priest. King Herod also did so when he ruled Judea (starting in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">37 BC</code>).</p>

    <p>During the life of Jesus, Judea was under the direct rule of a Roman governor/prefect. It was the Roman governor (such as Pontius Pilate) who appointed the high priests. They almost always appointed high priests from wealthy families of the…</p>

    <p>In the time of Jesus, the high priest was very influential, even to the Romans. Because Rome recognized him as the representative of the Jewish nation.</p>

    <p>Thus the relationship between the Roman governors of Judea and the high priests was complex. On the one hand, the governors appointed the high priests. But on the other hand, the high priest can potentially get a governor fired by complaining to Rome.</p>

<h2 id="d-the-samaritans">D. The Samaritans:</h2>

<p>The NT mentions the Samaritans (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matt 10:5</code>; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">John ch. 4</code>). It makes it clear that they do not get along well with the Jews. The first Samaritans become Christians in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Acts 8</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Their Origins</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2 Kings 17</code> records the fall of Samaria to Assyria. The Assyrians deported thousands of Israelites. But they also imported thousands of people from other countries to live in Israel. The Samaritans are probably a result of the racial mixing between the Israelites who remained and the Gentiles who were brought in. They did worship Yahweh as God, but they only recognized the Torah as Scripture, not the Prophets or the Writings. They also believed the temple should be on Mt. Gerizim (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Deut 11:29, 27: 12</code>; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Josh 8:33; 4:20</code>), not in Jerusalem.</p>
