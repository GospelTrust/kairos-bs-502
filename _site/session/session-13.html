The Years Just Before the Birth of Jesus            Year      Event                  37 BC      Herod the Great becomes ruler of Judea              30 BC      Octavian is affirmed as the overall leader of Rome.              27 BC      Octavian receives the title Augustus → Caesar Augustus.              ±19 BC      Herod the Great begins a massive repair &amp; expansion of the temple; the main work takes 8-10 years. [The entire project will not be completed until AD 63.] This will be the impressive building that the disciples point out to Jesus (Luke 21:5).      II. The Earthly Life &amp; Ministry of Jesus            Year      Event                  6 BC      Jesus is born in Bethlehem [Jesus was born roughly two years before Herod the Great died.]              4 BC      Herod the Great dies; his kingdom is divided three ways among three of his sons.              AD 6      The reign of the Herod family ends, and Judea reverts to being a Roman province. As a Roman province, Judea is now governed directly by a Roman governor = a Roman prefect. [This is when the Jewish sect the Zealots arose.]              AD 26      Pontius Pilate becomes Prefect/governor of Judea. He will govern until AD 36              ±AD 27      Jesus’ public Ministry begins. He is about 30 years old (Luke 3:23).              AD 30      Jesus is crucified, dead and buried. But not for long. [The other possible date for the crucifixion of Jesus is AD 33.  The professor thinks the biblical accounts fit best with a date of AD 30.]      III. The Earliest = The  Apostolic Age            Year      Event                  AD 30      Pentecost — The Holy Spirit comes upon the disciples with power. The first preaching of the gospel by the apostles, by Peter.              ±AD 31      The first Samaritans respond to the gospel, in Samaria (Acts 8). It is authenticated by Peter and John; the Samaritan believers receive the Holy Spirit (Acts 8:14-17).              ±AD 33      Paul’s conversion.  [His Jewish name was ‘Saul’; his Roman name was ‘Paul’; Acts 13:9.]              ±AD 34      The first Gentiles believe the gospel, when Peter preaches to the house of Cornelius (Acts 10). The Holy Spirit comes upon them (Acts 10:44-47).              47-48      Paul’s first missionary journey (Paul &amp; Barnabas).              AD 49      The Acts 15 Jerusalem Council. [This is the first church council. It addressed the question: Do Gentiles need to be circumcised to be saved? Its answer was: No.]              49-52      Paul’s second missionary journey. (Paul &amp; Silas).              50-70      [Most of the NT epistles will be written from AD 50 until AD 70.]              53-57      Paul’s third missionary journey. (Luke is with Paul for much of this journey).              AD 54      Nero becomes Emperor of Rome (until AD 68).              AD 57      Paul returns to Jerusalem; he is arrested there.              ±57-59      Paul imprisoned at Caesarea for two years (Acts 24:27).              AD 60      Paul arrives in Rome.              60-62      Paul remains in Rome under “house arrest.” The book of Acts ends here.              ±AD 63      It appears that Paul was released from house arrest, based on the comments in 1 &amp; 2 Timothy and Titus.              AD 64      Rome burns, and is largely destroyed. Nero blames the Christians. The persecution of Christians begins.              ±65/66      Paul is re-arrested.              AD 66      The Jews revolt against Rome.              AD 67      Roman armies lay siege to Jerusalem.              ±AD 67      Death of Paul in Rome under the persecution of Nero.

AD 73      Destruction/suicide of the final Jewish resistance at Masada              ±AD 100      Death of the Apostle John; end of the Apostolic age.      " />
