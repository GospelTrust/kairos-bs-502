<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Bear in mind the mind the prior theological framework provided by Scripture comes before the passage you are reading. This can also be called the <strong>redemptive-historical setting</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With narrative, read it in a straight-forward manner unless there are good reasons to do otherwise.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In narrative proper… <em>narrator speaks</em>
        <ol>
          <li>Always true</li>
          <li>Very little figurative language</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>But in dialogue and speeches…
        <ul>
          <li>more figurative language</li>
          <li>more idioms</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>An example of figurative language from the Gospel of John: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">John 7:37-39</code></p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>37 On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. 38 Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them." 39 By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive.

</ol>

<h2 id="b-in-the-acts-of-the-apostles">B. In the Acts of the Apostles:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Regarding major <em>sermons</em> by the apostles in the book of Acts… <em>they are rock solid</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Many <em>events</em> recorded in the book of Acts are <em>unique</em>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Peter’s first sermon</li>
      <li>First gentile’s conversion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acts is a book of… <strong>transition</strong></p>

    <p>This distinguishes it from the <em>epistles</em>, which give us <strong>normative</strong> teaching and practice.</p>

    <p>An example of an event that reflects a <strong>transition</strong>: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Acts 19:1-7</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>A suggestion from the professor, as regards understanding and applying the book of Acts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <strong>events</strong> in the book of Acts may or may not set examples that are normative for Christians</p>

    <p>However, we may look to the <strong>sermons</strong> in the book of Acts for dependable, normative doctrine.</p>
