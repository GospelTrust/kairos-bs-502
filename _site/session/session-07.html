  <meta name="description" content="Handout 05  A. The Importance of ContextAs concerns the genre of Scripture—While much of the Bible is written using figurative language (see [Handout #07] on OT Poetry), nonetheless, most of the Bible is written in a straight-forward manner.As concerns semantics—While we need to carefully examine the meaning &amp; use of some words in the Bible, nonetheless, most of the time the meaning of the words used in the Bible is clear.Since that is the case, then in general, the single most important factor for interpreting the Bible correctly is paying attention to the context.B. Correctly Appreciating the Context      Do not read the Bible as if it were made up of unconnected verses, floating in space.    For example: We examined James 2:24 in Handout #04 (“Semantics &amp; Grammar”).          James 2:24 — “We see that a person is justified by works, and not by faith alone.”        One key insight in interpreting James 2:24 was to examine the semantic range of the verb, “to justify.”    What was the other key insight for rightly interpreting James 2:24?                  Question: Which book of the Bible can we read as separate individual verses?                    Answer:                  To be specific: The meaning of the verse must fit the local context and(!) the larger structure of the book.    Example: Romans 14:22 reads:          “Whatever you believe about these things, keep between yourself and God.”        Does this mean we should not share the gospel?                  So it is very important to ask: What is Paul talking about in Romans ch. 14?                    Answer:                  Similarly: Do not violate either the clear general teaching of scripture or the local context of a passage    For example: It is legitimate to say,          I do not know what to do with James 2, because it seems to contradict Romans, Galatians, Ephesians and the Gospel of John.        When we say that, we are respecting the clear general teaching of Scripture.    On the other hand, it is not legitimate to conclude,          The purpose of James 2, I guess, must be to explain that we are saved by faith apart from works.        If we did that, we would be ignoring the local context of James ch. 2.  C. Some Examples of Passages which Have a Fairly Lengthy Local Context:  Romans 1-8 (!)  Romans 9-11.  1 Corinthians 8-10.  1 Corinthians 12-14.  Galatians 1-4  Hebrews 1-10.D. Two Quick Practice Examples:  Habakkuk 1:14 — “You have made men like the fish of the sea…” ← Means what?  What topic is Paul addressing in Gal 3:28?E. One Quick Example for Thought:In 1 Corinthians 14:20, Paul tells the Corinthians,  “Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regards to evil be infants, but in your thinking, be adults.”From the local context, can we determine what Paul thought was child-like in their thinking?F. One Specific Example: Romans 2:13Romans 2:6-8, and 2:13 read as follows:  6 “God will give to each person according to what he has done. 7 To those who persist in doing good and seeking glory, honor and immortality, God will give eternal life. 8 But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.”  13 “For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.”So → Are we saved by works? If we wish to go to heaven, do we need to be good all of the time, so that we can earn our way to heaven? How are we to understand this passage?" />

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Do not read the Bible as if it were made up of unconnected verses, floating in space.</p>

    <p>For example: We examined <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">James 2:24</code> in <a href="/session/session-04">Handout #04</a> (“Semantics &amp; Grammar”).</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">James 2:24</code> — “We see that a person is <em>justified by works</em>, and not by faith alone.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>One key insight in interpreting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">James 2:24</code> was to examine the semantic range of the verb, “to justify.”</p>

    <p>What was the other key insight for rightly interpreting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">James 2:24</code>?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Question: Which book of the Bible can we read as separate individual verses?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Answer:</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To be specific: The meaning of the verse must fit the <em>local context</em> and(!) the <em>larger structure of the book</em>.</p>

    <p>Example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Romans 14:22</code> reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>“Whatever you believe about these things, keep between yourself and God.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Does this mean we should not share the gospel?</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>So it is very important to ask: What is Paul talking about in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Romans ch. 14</code>?</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similarly: Do not violate either the <em>clear general teaching of scripture</em> or the <em>local context of a passage</em></p>

    <p>For example: It is legitimate to say,</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I do not know what to do with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">James 2</code>, because it seems to contradict Romans, Galatians, Ephesians and the Gospel of John.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When we say that, we are respecting the clear general teaching of Scripture.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Romans 1-8</code> (!)</li>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Habakkuk 1:14</code> — “You have made men like the fish of the sea…” ← Means what?</li>
  <li>What <em>topic</em> is Paul addressing in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gal 3:28</code>?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="e-one-quick-example-for-thought">E. One Quick Example for Thought:</h2>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1 Corinthians 14:20</code>, Paul tells the Corinthians,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Brothers, stop thinking like children. In regards to evil be infants, but in your thinking, be adults.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the local context, can we determine what Paul thought was child-like in their thinking?</p>

<h2 id="f-one-specific-example-romans-213">F. One Specific Example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Romans 2:13</code></h2>
<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Romans 2:6-8</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2:13</code> read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6 “God will give to each person according to what he has done. 7 To those who persist in doing good and seeking glory, honor and immortality, God will give eternal life. 8 But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, there will be wrath and anger.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>13 “For it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in God’s sight, but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So → Are we saved by works? If we wish to go to heaven, do we need to be good all of the time, so that we can earn our way to heaven? How are we to understand this passage?</p>
