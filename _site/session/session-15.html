The Way Parables Are Framed in the Gospels / Their Local Context      Sometimes they come in a cluster of parables, which are all about the same topic.    Example:    When this is the case, it is a good idea to… read through them        Often, they arise from a conversation, or from a question someone puts to Jesus. When this is the case, it is important to observe two things:          starts      conclusion        Example: The Parable of the Good Samaritan, Luke 10.                  Q: What is the first verse of the parable itself?                    Q: But where does this account begin?                    Q: What is the last verse of the parable itself?                    Q: What verse gives the conclusion, the application, of the parable?            So we see that, to read the parable in its context, we need to…II. Are Parables the Same as Allegories, or Different?A. What are Allegories?An allegory is an extended story that is told to teach something In allegories,… not quite, has one main pointB. How Are Parables Similar to Allegories?Parables are similar in that…C. How Are Parables Different from Allegories?Parables are different from allegories in that…The NT parable that comes closest to an allegory is… parable of the sowerAn example for practice: The Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10).III. For NT Parables: Identify the Main Point; Identify the Main CharactersA. Identify the One Main Point of the Parable.For the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10) —      The parable itself begins at which verse?        But where does the overall account begin?        Which verse states the main conclusion / application of the parable?  B. Note the Main Characters in the Parable.Unlike with allegories, NT parables do not make a point out of every detail.But the main characters in a parable probably do represent someone or something.An example: The Parable of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15).  The parable itself begins at which verse?  But where does the overall account begin?  For this parable, does Jesus make a concluding statement after the parable in which he gives the conclusion / the application of the parable?  Who are the main characters in this parable? Who or what do they represent?  What is this parable trying to teach us?IV. Why Did Jesus Use Parables?      Since parables use stories,… Easily to follow        But they also have an additional two-fold purpose:          To reveal spiritual truth… whose hearts open and ears to hear              To conceal spiritual truth… closed to hearts        The following passages from the gospels describe this two-fold purpose:        Mark 3:23                  So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables                Mark 4:34 (see similarly John 16:29)                  He did not say anything to them [= to the crowd] without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, he explained everything.                Matt 13:10-17 (see also Mark 4:10-12)                  10 The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”                          11 He replied, “Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. 12 Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 13 This is why / speak to them in parables:                          “Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.                          14 In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah:                          “‘You will be ever hearing but never understanding; you will be ever seeing but never perceiving.                          15 For this people’s heart has become calloused; they hardly hear with their ears, and they have closed their eyes.                          Otherwise they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hearts and turn, and / would heal them. [from Isaiah 6:9-10]                          16 But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. 17 For truly I tell you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see but did not see it, and longed to hear what you hear but did not hear it.                    V. Summary / Conclusions:The parables in the New Testament are designed to reveal truth to those who are willing to hear it, but to conceal truth from those whose hearts are hard. If we know something of the customs and the setting of Jesus’ time, it will help us to understand them.Primarily, we should look for the main point the parable is making. We should also attention to the main characters in a parable. And we should always pay attention to the situation into which the parable was spoken." />

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes they come in a cluster of parables, which are all about the same topic.</p>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <p>When this is the case, it is a good idea to… <em>read through them</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Often, they arise from a conversation, or from a question someone puts to Jesus. When this is the case, it is important to observe two things:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><em>starts</em></li>
      <li><em>conclusion</em></li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Example</strong>: The Parable of the <strong>Good Samaritan</strong>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Luke 10</code>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: What is the first verse of the parable itself?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: But where does this account begin?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: What is the last verse of the parable itself?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Q</strong>: What verse gives the conclusion, the application, of the parable?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So we see that, to read the parable in its context, we need to…</p>

<h2 id="ii-are-parables-the-same-as-allegories-or-different">II. Are Parables the Same as Allegories, or Different?</h2>

<h3 id="a-what-are-allegories">A. What are Allegories?</h3>

<p>An allegory is an extended story that is told to teach something In allegories,… <em>not quite, has one main point</em></p>

<h3 id="b-how-are-parables-similar-to-allegories">B. How Are Parables Similar to Allegories?</h3>

<p>Parables are similar in that…</p>

<h3 id="c-how-are-parables-different-from-allegories">C. How Are Parables Different from Allegories?</h3>

<p>Parables are different from allegories in that…</p>

<p>The NT parable that comes closest to an allegory is… <em>parable of the sower</em></p>

<p>An example for practice: <strong>The Parable of the Good Samaritan</strong> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Luke 10</code>).</p>

<h2 id="iii-for-nt-parables-identify-the-main-point-identify-the-main-characters">III. For NT Parables: Identify the Main Point; Identify the Main Characters</h2>

<h3 id="a-identify-the-one-main-point-of-the-parable">A. Identify the One Main Point of the Parable.</h3>

<p>For the parable of the Good Samaritan (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Luke 10</code>) —</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The parable itself begins at which verse?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But where does the overall account begin?</p>
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="b-note-the-main-characters-in-the-parable">B. Note the Main Characters in the Parable.</h3>

<p>Unlike with allegories, NT parables do <em>not</em> make a point out of every detail.</p>

<p>But the main characters in a parable probably <em>do</em> represent someone or something.</p>

<p>An example: <strong>The Parable of the Prodigal Son</strong> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Luke 15</code>).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The parable itself begins at which verse?</li>
  <li>But where does the overall account begin?</li>
  <li>For this parable, does Jesus make a concluding statement after the parable in which he gives the conclusion / the application of the parable?</li>
  <li>Who are the main characters in this parable? Who or what do they represent?</li>
  <li>What is this parable trying to teach us?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iv-why-did-jesus-use-parables">IV. Why Did Jesus Use Parables?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Since parables use stories,… <em>Easily to follow</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>But they also have an additional two-fold purpose:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>To <em>reveal</em> spiritual truth… <em>whose hearts open and ears to hear</em></li>
      <li>
        <p>To <em>conceal</em> spiritual truth… <em>closed to hearts</em></p>

        <p>The following passages from the gospels describe this two-fold purpose:</p>

        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mark 3:23</code></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>So Jesus called them over to him and began to speak to them in parables</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mark 4:34</code> (see similarly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">John 16:29</code>)</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>He did not say anything to them [= to the crowd] without using a parable. But when he was alone with his own disciples, <strong>he explained everything</strong>.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Matt 13:10-17</code> (see also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Mark 4:10-12</code>)</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>10 The disciples came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”</p>

Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 13 This is why / speak to them in parables:</p>

<h2 id="v-summary--conclusions">V. Summary / Conclusions:</h2>

<p>The parables in the New Testament are designed to reveal truth to those who are willing to hear it, but to conceal truth from those whose hearts are hard. If we know something of the customs and the setting of Jesus’ time, it will help us to understand them.</p>

<p>Primarily, we should <em>look for the main point the parable is making</em>. We should also attention to the main characters in a parable. And we should always pay attention to the situation into which the parable was spoken.</p>
